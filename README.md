This script will work on Debian, Ubuntu and probably other distros
of the same families, although no support is offered for them. It isn't
bulletproof but it will probably work if you simply want to setup a Stalker WM Portal on
your Debian/Ubuntu box. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and
universal as possible.

Snake24564 modified this script to install Ministra 5.6 for Ubuntu and Debian and made it that you can now install Stalker Middleware 5.2 when you press install Stalker Middleware.
